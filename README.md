# Cadmus
Blogging Site made in PHP and mysql.
This was a project made during my undergraduate studies as a part of one of my course. A typical blog contains necessary content and the related photographs. The website includes an admin portal, the person who manages all the blog and can also write his own blog and a normal user who can see all the blogs, write his own blog but cannot edit or delete the blog. Any user can like, dislike or add comment to a blog. There is also a edit/add profile functionality.

Blogs are saved on the database and are dynamically generated directly from the database to be shown on the dashboard. All Likes, dislikes and comments information are also saved on the database. Whenever the owner of a blog decide to edit his blog, his old content will be updated with new and necessary changes will be made in the database.
